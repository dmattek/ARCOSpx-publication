ARCOS.px is a computational method to identify and track clusters of correlated cell signaling in time-lapse microscopy images. 
It is the latest addition to the [ARCOS ecosystem](https://arcos.gitbook.io/home) developed in the [Cellular Dynamics Lab](https://www.pertzlab.net) at the University of Bern.
ARCOS.px is a [Python software package](https://github.com/bgraedel/arcos4py), and a [dedicated interactive plugin](https://github.com/bgraedel/arcosPx-napari) for the [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) image viewer.

# Scripts
